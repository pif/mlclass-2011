function [J, grad] = costFunction(theta, X, y)
%COSTFUNCTION Compute cost and gradient for logistic regression
%   J = COSTFUNCTION(theta, X, y) computes the cost of using theta as the
%   parameter for logistic regression and the gradient of the cost
%   w.r.t. to the parameters.

m = length(y); % number of training examples
ho = sigmoid(theta'*X');
ho = ho';
J = sum(-y.*log(ho)-(1-y).*log(1-ho))/m;
grad = (ho-y)' * X / m;

% You need to return the following variables correctly
